Output can be new unit vector towards the mine: [x,y]
Don't limit rotation
But, magnitude of directon is same as in move_sweeper_ideal
  min speed is what happens if rotate 90 degrees OR MORE (so 91 degrees to 180 degrees)
  max speed is what happens if go straight

Still have to deal with clockwise vs. counterclockwise ? Maybe not

So conclusion - only 2 outputs from neural net for unit vector to move [x,y]

inputs are current position and look vector (or rotation angle?)
  - If look vector then 4 inputs
	- If rotation then 3 inputs (but how to represent rotation angle, just in radians?)
